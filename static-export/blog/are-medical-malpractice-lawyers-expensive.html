<p>If you&#8217;re thinking about suing for medical malpractice, you should know how much hiring a lawyer will cost. This article explains medical malpractice lawyers expensive fee structure, what a &#8220;contingency fee&#8221; is, and other costs involved in a lawsuit. Understanding these things can help you decide if hiring a lawyer is the right choice.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Is a Medical Malpractice Case and Why Hire a Lawyer?</h2>



<p>A medical malpractice case happens when a doctor or hospital makes a serious mistake that hurts someone. Hiring a <a href="https://thelobblawfirm.com/blog/the-top-10-reasons-you-need-a-medical-malpractice-lawyer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">medical malpractice lawyer is very important</a> because these cases are hard to prove. Lawyers help you understand complicated state laws and gather evidence, like medical records, to show what went wrong.</p>



<p><a href="https://wp.thomasandwan.com/choosing-the-right-medical-malpractice-lawyer-thomas-and-wan/" data-wpil-monitor-id="19">Lawyers know how to find the right medical</a> experts who can explain the mistake and show why the doctor was negligent. They also take care of paying expert witness fees, which can be expensive. Without a lawyer, it’s tough to win these kinds of cases.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Does Contingency Fee Agreement Work</h2>



<p>You might wonder, “How much does it cost to hire a medical malpractice attorney?” Most medical malpractice lawyers work on something called a &#8220;<a href="https://www.franciswilksandjones.co.uk/what-is-a-contingency-fee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contingency fee</a>&#8221; or &#8221; contingent fee&#8221; basis. This means they only get paid if you win your case. If you win, the lawyer takes a percentage of the money you get from the settlement or from winning in court.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wp.thomasandwan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Contingency-Fee-Agreement.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://wp.thomasandwan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Contingency-Fee-Agreement.jpg" alt="Contingency Fee Agreement" class="wp-image-1308" srcset="https://wp.thomasandwan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Contingency-Fee-Agreement.jpg 1000w, https://wp.thomasandwan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Contingency-Fee-Agreement-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wp.thomasandwan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Contingency-Fee-Agreement-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></figure>



<p>With a contingency fee arrangement, you don’t have to worry about paying the lawyer upfront. This makes it easier to get help from a lawyer, even if you don’t have a lot of money. It’s a good idea to ask the lawyer what percentage they will take before agreeing to work with them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Are the Other Costs of Filing a Medical Malpractice Lawsuit?</h2>



<p>There are other costs when filing a medical malpractice lawsuit besides what you pay the lawyer. For example, lawyers need to hire experts to prove your case, and these experts charge fees. They also need to get your medical records, which costs money.</p>



<p>You might not have to pay these lawyer fees right away, but they can be taken out of the money you win. Your lawyer will explain all of these costs before you go to court so you can be ready.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Are Attorney Fees Structured in Medical Malpractice Cases?</h2>



<p>Attorney fees, or what lawyers charge, can be different depending on the case. Many medical lawyers take <a href="https://www.finchmccranie.com/blog/understanding-legal-fees-what-to-know-about-medical-malpractice-lawyers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">based on a percentage of what you win</a>, but some states have rules about how much that can be.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wp.thomasandwan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Attorney-Fees-Structured-in-Medical-Malpractice-Cases.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="524" src="https://wp.thomasandwan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Attorney-Fees-Structured-in-Medical-Malpractice-Cases.jpg" alt="Attorney Fees Structured in Medical Malpractice Cases" class="wp-image-1311" srcset="https://wp.thomasandwan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Attorney-Fees-Structured-in-Medical-Malpractice-Cases.jpg 1000w, https://wp.thomasandwan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Attorney-Fees-Structured-in-Medical-Malpractice-Cases-300x157.jpg 300w, https://wp.thomasandwan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Attorney-Fees-Structured-in-Medical-Malpractice-Cases-768x402.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></figure>



<p>Some lawyers charge based on hours worked, and others use a contingency fee agreement. Before you start, make sure you ask the lawyer how much it will cost and how they charge their fees. This way, there are no surprises later.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Much Does It Cost to Pursue a Medical Malpractice Case?</h2>



<p>The total lawyer cost of a medical malpractice lawsuit depends on a few things. You have to pay for expert witnesses, medical records, and a percentage of your settlement to your lawyer. While many lawyers work on a contingency fee basis, the case can still be expensive.</p>



<p>Most lawyers offer a free consultation, where they talk to you about your case and the possible costs. They can help you decide if it’s worth it to go forward with the lawsuit.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is It Worth Hiring a Medical Malpractice Lawyer?</h2>



<p>Even though hiring a lawyer can be expensive, it can help you win your case. Lawyers know a lot about medical malpractice, state laws, and expert witnesses. They can build a strong case to help you get a fair settlement or win in court.</p>



<p>Many lawyers will talk to you for free to see if you have a good case. The right law firm can make the whole process easier for you.</p>



<p>If you are thinking about <a href="https://wp.thomasandwan.com/why-does-it-take-so-long-to-file-a-lawsuit-2/" data-wpil-monitor-id="20">filing a malpractice claim lawsuit</a> for medical negligence, it’s a good idea to talk to a lawyer.
