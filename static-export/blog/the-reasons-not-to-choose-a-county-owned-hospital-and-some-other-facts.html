<p>Knowing what hospital to choose for your medical needs is
important. I am not saying that a county-owned or government-owned hospital is
a bad place and that you can’t be treated there. I am just simply saying it is
really hard to sue a government-owned hospital for medical malpractice in the
event the hospital’s negligence causes something bad to happen to you. The
Texas Tort Claims Act protects them because these hospitals are owned by the
government. I personally did not know this before I started working at my law
firm. I figured anyone could be sued at any time for any wrongdoing. With
research and learning more about this field; I was proved wrong, and it is why
I am writing this article today.&nbsp; When it
comes to doctors, nurses, and staff that work at county-owned hospitals, they
are also protected by the Texas Tort Claims Act.</p>



<p>If you want to sue a county-owned hospital or a doctor that
works at a county hospital, you need to know there is a STRICT 6-month time
limit on giving written notice to the hospital or doctor in Texas.&nbsp; Usually, in Texas, you have two years from
the date of the malpractice to bring a lawsuit.&nbsp;
However, if you want to sue a county-owned hospital or doctor that works
at a county hospital, you must send written notice that is received by the
hospital or doctor within 6 months after the date of the malpractice.&nbsp; If you do not send written notice within 6
months you are FOREVER BARRED from suing that county hospital or doctor.&nbsp; Bottom line, if you or your family member
suffered serious injury or death from a county-owned hospital or doctor, you
need to act fast.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Under the Texas Tort Claims Act, &nbsp;there are “caps” on damages that a plaintiff
can be awarded. For medical malpractice cases against a county-owned hospital
or doctor that works at a county hospital, the limit on damages is essentially
$100,000 total—that’s for all damages, both economic and non-economic.&nbsp; Please note that for private hospitals and
doctors, the caps are different.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Now I am not telling you to seek out a hospital that isn’t a
county-owned hospital; I am simply just giving you some facts I found
interesting. We all go to the hospital hoping nothing bad will happen, but this
isn’t always the case. Just do your homework before hand. Know what hospital is
closest to you in the event you need to go. Know what hospitals are a government-owned
hospital and which are not. Make the best choice for you. </p>
