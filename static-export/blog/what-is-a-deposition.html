<p>A deposition
can sound scary and daunting. What is the purpose of a deposition? I have
already told my lawyer my side, why do I have to say it formally? </p>



<p><strong>A
deposition is taking an oral statement of a witness under oath before a trial. The
lawyers for the hospitals or doctors you have sued will ask you questions about
what happened and about your injuries.&nbsp; This
serves the purpose to find out what the witness knows and to preserve the
witness testimony. The intended use is to allow the parties to have all the
facts prior to trial.</strong>
</p>



<p>You always
want your story on the record. Typically, your lawyer, the defense lawyer and a
court reporter are present during a deposition. Sometimes a videographer is
present as well. A deposition is taken at the lawyer’s office, court reporter
office, or a mutually agreed upon place. This is generally not done at a
person’s home. Don’t be scared, just speak your truth. The truth will set you
free. Don’t lie; you will get caught. This will only hurt your case and why
would you want to do that? If there is something you are concerned about
getting out, or being asked, tell your attorney right away so they can see what
the right course of action is for you. Your lawyer is here to help and can
answer any of your questions. <strong>If you aren’t fully informing your lawyer, she
can’t help you.&nbsp; Trust YOUR lawyers.&nbsp; Don’t be embarrassed to share—they’ve heard
it all before and nothing fazes them.</strong></p>



<p>A deposition
sometimes can take an hour and or can take all day. It really depends on what
information is needed from you or a witness. Although it is annoying to take
time off work or make arrangements to care for children, keep in mind a lawsuit
is a serious matter that requires serious legal proceedings. Your lawyers are
constantly working in your best interest. We are also taking depositions of
witnesses against whom you are claiming wronged you. </p>



<p>If at any
point you have a question about your case or what is happening, please ask.
Sometimes it may feel like nothing is being done, but trust me, there are a lot
of components into winning your potential case. Depositions, especially in
medical malpractice cases, take a lot of time. Why, you ask? Many people have
to be deposes—you, your family members who witnessed the events or know about
your injuries, deposition of the doctors, nurses, hospital representatives who
played a part in causing your injury or your family member’s death, as well as
the experts who reviewed your medical records and will provide testimony as to
who is at fault. </p>



<p>Please keep
in mind, we don’t get your deposition back the same day; the court reporter and
videographer must take what they have just typed/videoed and make into a
legally bound document/flash drive that then it gets delivered to both the
plaintiffs and the defendants. This process can take weeks. </p>
