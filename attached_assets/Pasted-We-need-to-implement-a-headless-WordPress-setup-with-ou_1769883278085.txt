We need to implement a headless WordPress setup with our existing Replit front-end.

Goal:
- WordPress is the source of truth for ALL content (Pages + Blog posts).
- The Replit site renders SERVER-SIDE HTML output (SEO friendly). 
- When we update/publish content in WordPress, the Replit front-end should display it automatically.

Please confirm which architecture we’ll use and implement the simplest working version first.

OPTIONS (pick 1 to start, but design for future upgrades):

Option A (Fastest proof / MVP):
- Replit fetches WordPress content via REST API:
  - Pages: /wp-json/wp/v2/pages?slug=...
  - Posts: /wp-json/wp/v2/posts?slug=... and /posts?per_page=...
- Render page.content.rendered and post.content.rendered inside our Replit layout (styled container like “prose”).
- Must be server-side rendered (Next.js SSR / SSG with revalidate). Output must be full HTML on first load.

Option B (Best long-term / exact design control):
- Use structured fields in WordPress (ACF or similar) for page sections:
  - hero_title, hero_subtitle, cards[], faq[], etc.
- Replit maps these fields into our components (no dumping raw WP HTML except in controlled rich text areas).
- Still server-side rendered HTML output.

Option C (Advanced / not for phase 1):
- Parse WP blocks and map blocks -> React components.
- Only do if we decide we need full block support.

Requirements:
- Keep URLs the same as current site where possible (slug parity). If slugs change, add 301 redirects.
- Blog routes:
  - /blog (index)
  - /blog/[slug] (single)
- Pages routes:
  - /[slug] for basic pages (about, services, etc.)
  - homepage should pull WP front-page content or a known slug (like “home”).
- SEO:
  - Output title/meta tags (use WP SEO fields if available or fallback to WP title/excerpt).
  - Canonical tags set correctly.

Questions for you:
1) Is our Replit project Next.js (app router or pages router)? If not, recommend converting to Next for SSR.
2) Do we need a proxy route to avoid CORS or can we rely on server-side fetch?
3) Which option (A or B) do you recommend for phase 1 given our timeline (15 pages)?
