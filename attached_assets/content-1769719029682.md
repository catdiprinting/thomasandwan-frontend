## Did You Know…?

[![](https://www.thomasandwan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/img-did-you-know1.gif)](https://www.thomasandwan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/img-did-you-know1.gif)

**1\. Medical malpractice is the third leading cause of death in the United States.**

According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, malpractice comes in behind cancer and heart disease when it comes to the number of deaths in this country.

**2\. Medical negligence causes between 65,000 and 200,000 deaths each year.**

According to the Civil Justice Resource Group, there are between 65,000 and 200,000 medical negligence-related deaths each year. As a point of reference, there are 46,000 car accident-related deaths reported in the United States annually.

**3\. For every four injuries or deaths caused by medical malpractice, only one is recorded in medical records.**

This means that there are actually about four times as many deaths and injuries each year than are listed above.

**4\. Diagnostic errors are the most frequent type of medical malpractice case.**

33 percent of malpractice suits are related to diagnosis. Surgical malpractice follows closely behind, comprising 24 percent of malpractice cases. Treatment errors make up 18 percent, and obstetric cases make up 11 percent. Medication, monitoring, and anesthesia comprise 3 to 4 percent each of all malpractice cases.

**5\. According to a CONSUMER REPORTS MARCH 2016 ANALYSIS: Less than 5 percent of U.S. doctors are responsible for 50% of medical malpractice lawsuits.**

This means that the same few doctors are repeatedly making serious and life-threatening mistakes. Fortunately, a medical malpractice lawsuit can prevent others from receiving similar dangerous treatment. By waging a lawsuit, victims can raise public awareness of medical malpractice and prevent a negligent doctor from practicing medicine in the future.
