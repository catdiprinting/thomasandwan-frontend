## Client Testimonials

I had a hard time coming to the terms with what happened to my baby at birth..and as I was looking thru and for a Medical Mal Practice attorney and her face was so welcoming I loved what I read and how long she has been an attorney. our first meet and greet I was anxious and emotional and she had a comfortable vibe in her tone of voice..her concern about what’s happened..and her smile… I instantly relaxed and what helped me thru my childbirth complications was she said it wasn’t my fault and gave me a hug I cried on her shoulder and it was such an amazing feeling..she understood what I was talking about… Linda Thomas, you are an amazing woman and I thank god for the opportunity of meeting a woman like yourself. I appreciate all you have helped me with and accomplished.

Thomas & Wan did a great job representing me and my family against the owner of our apartment complex. We have just moved in when our daughter was shot in the head by a stray bullet while she was sleeping in her bed. It was a miracle she survived. The lawyers at Thomas & Wan went to work right away and through research found out that there had been five murders at that complex the year before. They also found out that the complex didn’t hire security to patrol at night. They were able to settle the case without even having to go to trial. Now we’re going to have the money to take care of our little girl’s needs now and in the future.

After being abandoned by my original lawyer who was greedy for money, Linda was a TRUE answer to my prayers. She is after JUSTICE, not money. She has spent COUNTLESS hours researching my case and asking just the right questions. She has the heart of a saint; she really cares about her clients and it shows. I have emailed her outside of our visits asking for updates or just addressing concerns I have, and she answers right away. I also have been very anxious and stressed with my case as I suffer from PTSD due to it, and she is kind, gentle, and reassuring. It truly is having an angel by your side! I don’t know where I’d be without her, but I’m getting JUSTICE. If you want a piece of Heaven on Earth in your corner, GET LINDA!! She will fight for YOU, WITH you!

Linda and Michelle represented me when I was hurt at a refinery. I had tried using a different lawyer, but he never returned my calls or talked to me. Linda and Michelle did a good job and they care about your case.

— Rogelio L

Thomas & Wan represented my baby who was seriously harmed by nurses at a hospital who did not know what they were doing. Linda and Michelle were able to guide us through what to do in getting help for my baby for the rest of his life.
